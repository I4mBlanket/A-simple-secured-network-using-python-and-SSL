# A-simple-secured-network-using-python-and-SSL

How to set it up:
You will need to install the following:
pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install python openssl

And then you will need to use thr following command to create the cert.pem and the key.pem files:
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

And then type:
pip install certifi

Run the server script:
python secure_server.py

In another Termux session, run the client script:
python secure_client.py

Additional Tips:
----------------
File Paths:
Ensure the file paths for cert.pem and key.pem are correct. If these files are in your home directory, use the full path (/data/data/com.termux/files/home/cert.pem).

Permissions:
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the certificate and key files. You can try chmod +x *

Networking: Make sure Termux has the necessary permissions to use network sockets. Termux may have restrictions based on Android version and security settings. If you encounter any specific errors, you can google it :)

Detailed Description:
---------------------

1. OverviewSSL:
---------------
(Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. It ensures that data passed between the server and client remains private and integral.

-------------------------------------

3. Components:
--------------
The process involves two main components:

• Server: A server script that listens for incoming connections, establishes an SSL connection, and handles requests.

• Client: A client script that initiates an SSL connection to the server and sends/receives data securely.

-------------------------------------

5. How It WorksServer-Side:
---------------------------
Importing Libraries: Essential libraries like ssl, socket, and os are imported.

Setting Up Socket: A socket is created and configured to use IPv4 and TCP.

Binding and Listening: The server binds to a specified address and port, then listens for incoming connections.

SSL Wrapping: The socket is wrapped in an SSL context, which requires specifying SSL protocol versions, loading server certificates, and keys.

Accepting Connections: The server accepts incoming client connections and wraps them with SSL.

Handling Data: The server handles data sent by the client, sending responses back securely.

Error Handling: Errors during SSL handshake or communication are caught and logged.

-------------------------------------

Client-Side:
Importing Libraries: Similar libraries are imported on the client side.

Setting Up Socket: A client socket is created and wrapped with SSL.

SSL Wrapping: The SSL context is set up with protocol specifications and, optionally, server certificate verification.

Connecting to Server: The client connects to the server’s address and port securely using SSL.

Sending and Receiving Data: Data is sent to and received from the server over the secure connection.

Error Handling: Errors during connection or communication are handled and logged.

-------------------------------------

4. Use Cases:
-------------
Secure Data Transmission:
Web Applications: Ensuring secure data transmission between web servers and clients.

APIs: Protecting API endpoints that handle sensitive data.
Messaging Apps: Securing messages sent between users.

-------------------------------------

Authentication:
---------------
User Login Systems: Safeguarding user credentials during login processes.

E-commerce: Protecting payment details during transactions.

Private Networks:
-----------------
Internal Communications: Securing internal communications within an organization.

Remote Access: Securely connecting to remote servers and services.

-------------------------------------

6. Benefits:
Data Security: Encrypts data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
Authentication: Ensures that the server the client is communicating with is genuine.

Data Integrity: Protects data from being altered during transmission.
Confidentiality: Prevents eavesdropping on communication.

-------------------------------------

Conclusion:
The implemented secure server and client communication using SSL on Termux can be utilized in various applications where data security is paramount. This setup provides a robust foundation for secure data transmission, authentication, and confidentiality, which are essential components in today’s digital landscape.
